# Baseball-Simulator
This project simulates a baseball game using MLB average plate appearance outcomes from the 2019 season. By running a large number of simulations, we can extract information about the average MLB game, such as what percentage of games go to extra innings, or how many runs are scored in an average game. By adding different logic or behaviors to the program, we can ascertain the impact of different rule changes or player behaviors. For example, we can amend the code to place a runner on second base to start extra innings, as is done in the Minor Leagues, and we can determine what impact that has on the length of extra innings games.
